#Arcade Game Clone

This game is a remake of the Classic Frogger arcade game. This was made as my 5th project for my [Udacity](http://udacity.com) Front-end Developer Nanodegree.

## How to Play

To play this game go [here](http://lhernandez9x.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

#### Controls

The controls for this game are simple. The only keys you need to use are the directional keys.
The keys are mapped as follows:

- 'up' moves character **up** one space
- 'left' moves character **left** one space
- 'right' moves character **right** one space
- 'down' moves character **down** one space

## Object of Game
The object of this game is to accumulate enough points to win the game (2500 points) without losing all your lives (3). You must move the character up to the water and collect gems in order to get points. But watch out, you will lose points if you get hit by a bug.

#### Points

There are multiple ways to accumulate points.

1. Reach water = 50 points
2. Picking up gems
 - blue gem = 200 points
 - orange gems = 150 Points
 - green gems = 100 Points

Also everytime you collide with a bug, you will get -50 points.

#### Lives

You start the game with 3 lives. You lose a life every time you collide with a bug. The game will end once you have depleted your lives.
